# React Business Card
Site uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) dev tool.
<br>
Im learning react from a [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).
<br>
This project is similar to the first react project I had, however this one was all training wheels off. All the setup and coding was all by my self.
<br><br>
I am actually super proud of this and am looking forward to using this as a calling card elsewhere.
<br>
The goal here was to use react and CSS to recreate the template form [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card).
